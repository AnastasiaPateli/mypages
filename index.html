                <h3>Intersection Point</h3>
                <p>A creative 19-year-old student who loves mathematics, design, and philosophy,
                    but with a personality test that says that 99% of me is core research. 
                    I can not be only one thing. That is the reason I love Architecture. 
                    A challenge every day to be something different, to think in a way that you did not yesterday,
                    to create with a vision that tomorrow will make the world better. </p>
