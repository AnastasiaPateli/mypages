        <h1>Hi, I am Anastasia Anna Pateli and this is a website about me and my work.</h1>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in School of Architecture at National Technical University of Athens and 
            an excellence schollarship graduate of Athens College (2023).</p>

                <h3>Intersection Point</h3>
                <p>A creative 19-year old student that loves mathematics, design and phylosophy, 
                    but with a personality test that says that 99% of me is research in core. 
                    I can not be only one thing. I do not want to. And that is the reason I love Architecture, 
                    because I am challenged every day to be something different, to think in a way that I did not yesterday
                    and to create with a vision that tomorrow will make the world better. </p>

                <h4>"Aerial Breaths" Onassis AiR Spring Open Days 2025 Open</h4>
                <p>“<a href="https://www.onassis.org/initiatives/onassis-air/onassis-air-onx-fellowships/dimitris-papanikolaou-aerial-breaths">Aerial Breaths</a> is
                    a large-scale public art installation conceptualized and led by my professor, Mr. D. Papanikolaou. This project envisions a network of wirelessly 
                    connected giant inflatables placed at selected locations throughout Athens, allowing visitors in each site to physically experience the presence of others in remote locations. 
                    By challenging our perception of locality, belonging, and social identity, "Aerial Breaths" seeks to redefine urban connectivity and interaction. 
                    As a volunteer, I contributed to giving "breath" to this vision and I had the privilege of presenting the project at the Onassis AiR Spring Open Days 2025.</p>

                <h4>Final Project ”Hyperbolic Paraboloid” Class of ”Geometrical Illustrations” First Semester,
School of Architecture, NTUA</h4>
                <p>A collaborative research project exploring how a solid with double-ruled surfaces can be constructed using industrial flat surfaces. 
                    The hyperbolic paraboloid presents an optimal solution as double-ruled surface formed by straight lines, offering exceptional mechanical properties. 
                    This is a concept I aspire to further develop in the future, integrating architectural elements to design a building with an accompanying public space.</p>

                <h4>International Masterclass ”Hands on Particle Physics” </h4>
                <p>The project began with a visual exploration of ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (CERN). 
                    It also included an introduction to the fundamentals of particle therapy (radiation therapy) for cancer treatment. 
                    The research culminated in a collaborative effort to analyze diagrams illustrating the effectiveness of various particles—protons, photons, and carbon ions—in cancer treatment. 
                    Using MatRad (MATLAB), we proposed an optimized combination of beam angles and particle types to target cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. </p>

                <h4>Personal Project: ”Genetic engineering and DNA editing to combat genetic diseases” MYP
(Year 5), Psychico College</h4>
                <p>A six-month research project framed in the global context of Scientific and Technical Innovations, exploring the mechanism and applications of CRISPR-Cas9, a 
                    groundbreaking gene-editing technology that combines the bacterial immune system CRISPR with the Cas9 protein to precisely modify DNA.
                    Following the scientific method, my research led me to the conclusion that CRISPR-Cas9 holds significant potential for the treatment of genetic diseases, 
                    particularly multiple sclerosis. To integrate bioethical considerations, I conducted three interviews, allowing me to critically examine the ethical implications of gene editing. 
                    My goal was to inform and raise awareness among my classmates and the wider high school community about the transformative possibilities and ethical challenges of this technology.
                    As a final step, I explored the potential of 3D printing and design to visually represent my final products. Using specialized software, 
                    I created 3D models of two nerve cells, one damaged by multiple sclerosis and one healthy, as well as a CRISPR-Cas9 illustrating its role in modifying a DNA double helix.</p>
