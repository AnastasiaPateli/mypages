                <h3>Intersection Point</h3>
                <p>A creative 19-year old student that loves mathematics, design and phylosophy, 
                    but with a personality test that says that 99% of me is research in core. 
                    I can not be only one thing. And that is the reason I love Architecture, 
                    because you are challenged every day to be something different, to think in a way that you did not yesterday
                    and to create with a vision that tomorrow will make the world better. </p>
